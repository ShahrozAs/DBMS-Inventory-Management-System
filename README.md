Introduction 
 

Project is related to Inventory Management System
The project maintains three levels of users:-
•	Billing Counter Level
•	Manager Level
•	Owner Level
 Main facilities available in this project are:-
•	We can forecast the sales by analyzing the previous sales statistics.
•	We can get an idea that when we need to order new inventory.
•	We can reduce the chances of any kind of frauds done by the staff members 
in the inventory.
•	Customer details can be added.
•	Invoice generation.
We can keep a track of transactions received through different payment methods.

An inventory management system is the combination of technology (hardware and software) and processes and procedures that oversee the monitoring and maintenance of stocked products, whether those products are company assets, raw materials and supplies, or finished products ready to be sent to vendors or end consumers. This system can widely be used by normal shops, departmental stores or MNCs for keeping a proper track of the stock. It also consists of information like manager details, customer details etc. With the help of this system we can fix a minimum quantity of any inventory below which we need to place an order for that inventory. This will help us in good sales results and never the out of stock stage for any inventory.


SCOPE:  
This will help us in maintain the exact count of any product.  Can help us to set minimum quantity of any product below which we can order the product from manufacturer.  Can reduce duplicate entries


Background: 
   
This application is nowadays a basic use of any company, firm, shop, or departmental store because stock maintenance, stock forecasting are some things which are very essential these days for earning great profits. 
 
In ancient times we need to maintain the complete inventory in paper pen method. 
 
The ancient method is quite un-easy, uncomfortable, and sometimes inaccurate. For overcoming this problem, we came with a solution of inventory management system. From this system we can generate invoice for every purchase. In addition to this we can have the employee details, customer details in this system. 
 
In short, we can call this as all-in-one system...!! 

Purpose: 

INVENTORY MANAGEMENT must tie together the following objectives ,to ensure that there is continuity between functions : 
• Company’s Strategic Goals • Sales Forecasting • Sales & Operations Planning • Production & Materials Requirement Planning.
 Inventory Management must be designed to meet the dictates of market place and support the company’s Strategic Plan . The many changes in the market demand , new opportunities due to worldwide marketing , global sourcing of materials and new manufacturing technology means many companies need to change their Inventory Management approach and change the process for Inventory Control . Inventory Management system provides information to efficiently manage the flow of materials , effectively utilize people and equipment , coordinate internal activities and communicate with customers . Inventory Management does not make decisions or manage operations, they provide the information to managers who make more accurate and timely decisions to manage their operations. INVENTORY is defined as the blocked Working Capital of an organization in the form of materials . As this is the blocked Working Capital of organization, ideally it should be zero. But we are maintaining Inventory . This Inventory is maintained to take care of fluctuations in demand and lead time. In some cases it is maintained to take care of increasing price tendency of commodities or rebate in bulk buying.

Goals of proposed system:
 
1. Planned approach towards working: - The working in the organization will be well planned and organized. The data will be stored properly in data stores, which will help in retrieval of information as well as its storage. 
2. Accuracy: - The level of accuracy in the proposed system will be higher. All operation would be done correctly and it ensures that whatever information is coming from the center is accurate. 
3. Reliability: - The reliability of the proposed system will be high due to the above stated reasons. The reason for the increased reliability of the system is that now there would be proper storage of information. 
4. No Redundancy: - In the proposed system utmost care would be that no information is repeated anywhere, in storage or otherwise. This would assure economic use of storage space and consistency in the data stored. 
5. Immediate retrieval of information: - The main objective of proposed system is to provide for a quick and efficient retrieval of information. 
6. Immediate storage of information: - In manual system there are many problems to store the largest amount of information. 
7. Easy to Operate: - The system should be easy to operate and should be such that it can be developed within a short period of time and fit in the limited budget of the user

 


In this project we’ve only implemented the back end of the system which is designed 
 
on “SQL Plus” 
 
On this sequence query language, we created 10 tables named: 
  
 
1.	Brands 
 
2.	inv_user 
 
3.	Categories 
 
4.	Products 
 
5.	Stores 
 
6.	Providers 
 
7.	Customer_cart 
 
8.	Select_product 
 
9.	Transaction 
 
10.	Invoice
